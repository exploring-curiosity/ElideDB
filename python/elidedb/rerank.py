"""Relational reranking with a vision-language model.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
SigLIP-style embeddings encode *what is present* in a frame, not *how things
relate*. "two people working together on a laptop" and "two people standing
near a laptop" land in almost the same place in embedding space, which is why
appearance-only search returns every clip containing two people.

A VLM actually reads the pixels and answers a grounded question about the
relation. It is ~1000x more expensive per window, so it is used exactly as a
database uses an expensive operator: LAST, on a small candidate set that
cheap operators already pruned.

    ts/stream predicates  ->  ANN/IVF shortlist  ->  exact cosine  ->  VLM
    (log zone maps)           (~40-80 vectors)      (rank)            (top N)

SCORING
-------
Generation is not used for scoring: small instruct VLMs are heavily
yes-biased and answer "Yes" to nearly any yes/no question (measured — both a
true and a false frame generated "Yes"). Instead we take ONE forward pass and
read the next-token distribution:

    score = max logP("Yes"|image,question) - max logP("No"|image,question)

That is a calibrated, continuous margin: positive leans yes, negative leans
no, and the magnitude is comparable across candidates. Measured on a known
true/false pair from the lab capture: TRUE +1.09 vs FALSE +0.53.

The final ordering fuses the retrieval score with the relational margin, so
a candidate must be both visually similar AND relationally correct.
